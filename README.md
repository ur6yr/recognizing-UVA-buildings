The UVA Grounds is known for its Jeffersonian architecture and place in U.S. history as a model for college and university campuses throughout the country. Throughout its history, the University of Virginia has won praise for its unique Jeffersonian architecture.

We attempted to build an image recognition system to classify different buildlings/landmarks on Grounds. We used Tensorflow and Keras to build and train a CNN. The system is approximate 95% accurate.
